# TITLE

Maybe one day this repository will contain something really cool,
but at the moment it contains nothing useful.
Don't look at it, go away.

## Usage

This project is unusable because it is useless.
It is also unfinished and not working at the moment.
Don't try to use it, it won't do you any good, just leave.

## Installation

This poor little thing is so little and poor that
it is not yet available in any package manager and
the only way to get it is to build it yourself,
which I do not recommend doing because
the project is currently in an extremely unfinished state.

## Building

If desired, you can try to build this poor little thing yourself.
You will need a working `Cargo` build system.
Install it by following [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) guide.

Once the prerequisites have been installed,
you can build the thing by running this command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You might want to install the generated binary by running this command:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```
