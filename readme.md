# hvox's little scripts (at least some of them)

A collection of short scripts for various purposes.
Some of them do something useful, some not so much.
They were originally written for personal use only,
but let me know if anyone tries using them and finds a bug.

By the way, I still haven't figured out what programming language is best for writing such scripts.
Shell languages do not handle errors well and are often not powerful enough.
General-purpose languages are powerful enough, but unfortunately even the most concise ones become
very verbose when I try to use them to call a bunch of other scripts and process their output.
Right now I mostly use python and like it, but I'm open to try alternatives.
